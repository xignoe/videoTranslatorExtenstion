## Introduction

The Video Translator Chrome Extension is a browser extension that provides real-time translation and subtitle generation for any video or audio content on the web. Unlike existing text-only translation tools, this extension will detect audio from videos across all websites, transcribe the speech, translate it to the user's preferred language, and display synchronized subtitles overlaid on the video content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to automatically detect and translate audio from any video on any website, so that I can understand content in foreign languages without relying on existing subtitle availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a webpage with video content THEN the extension SHALL automatically detect the presence of video elements
2. WHEN video content is playing THEN the extension SHALL capture the audio stream in real-time
3. WHEN audio is detected THEN the extension SHALL transcribe the speech to text using speech recognition
4. WHEN transcription is available THEN the extension SHALL translate the text to the user's selected target language
5. WHEN translation is complete THEN the extension SHALL display synchronized subtitles overlaid on the video

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my preferred translation language and subtitle appearance, so that I can customize the extension to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display language selection options
2. WHEN the user selects a target language THEN the extension SHALL save this preference for future use
3. WHEN the user accesses subtitle settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for font size, color, position, and background
4. WHEN subtitle settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately to active subtitles
5. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN the system SHALL hide all subtitles and stop audio processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work seamlessly across different video platforms and websites, so that I have consistent translation capabilities regardless of where I'm watching content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits YouTube THEN the extension SHALL work alongside existing YouTube features without conflicts
2. WHEN the user visits streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) THEN the extension SHALL detect and translate their video content
3. WHEN the user encounters embedded videos on news sites or blogs THEN the extension SHALL process those videos
4. WHEN multiple videos are present on a page THEN the extension SHALL handle each video independently
5. WHEN video content uses different audio codecs THEN the extension SHALL adapt to process various audio formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the translation to be accurate and synchronized with the video timing, so that I can follow along naturally without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speech is transcribed THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 85% accuracy for clear audio
2. WHEN subtitles are displayed THEN they SHALL appear within 2 seconds of the corresponding audio
3. WHEN audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL indicate low confidence in transcription
4. WHEN multiple speakers are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to differentiate between speakers
5. WHEN audio contains background music or noise THEN the system SHALL filter out non-speech audio

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to respect privacy and security, so that my browsing activity and audio data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is processed THEN the system SHALL only process audio from active video tabs
2. WHEN transcription occurs THEN audio data SHALL be processed locally or through secure, encrypted connections
3. WHEN the user closes a tab THEN the system SHALL immediately stop processing audio from that tab
4. WHEN the extension is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL remove all stored user preferences and cached data
5. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL not store or transmit audio data beyond what's necessary for real-time translation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback about the extension's status, so that I know when it's working and can troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active on a page with video THEN the extension icon SHALL show an active state
2. WHEN audio is being processed THEN the system SHALL display a subtle indicator on the video
3. WHEN translation fails or encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN no audio is detected THEN the system SHALL indicate "no audio detected" status
5. WHEN the user clicks the extension icon THEN the system SHALL show current status and basic controls
